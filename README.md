This notebook is where I practice Python with the topics as below:

1. **Cryptography using text files (read files, write on file, create file, work with strings, try-except, and functions)**
    - Given decrypt_me.txt and encrypt_me.txt
    - Encrypt or decrypt the text file and save the result to a new file

2. **Fuel consumption (list, tuple, functions, and csv file manipulation)**
    - Given epaData2020.csv and epadata2015.csv
    - Find all the vehicles in the MPG interval that user provides (store vehicle's info in appropriate data structure)
    - Plot the trend using pylab

3. **Iris dataset (dictionaries, csv, summary statistics, and normalize data)**
    - Read data from iris.csv and store in dictionaries (key as species name and values as average of each of four features)
    - Print the summary statistics
    - Normalize data

4. **Diabetes Classifier using csv, random, pyplot, and numpy**
    - Manually build a diabetes classifier (80% training set and 20% testing set)
    - Confusion matrix
    - Plot a bar graph

5. **Using salaries.csv to manipulate, summarize, and visualize dataset by using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib)**
    - Summarize and visualize dataset
    - Test out some hypotheses

6. **Iris flower classification by using Scikit-Learn (DecisionTreeClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier)**
    - Build a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier
    - Plot the decision tree using plot_tree
    - Perform k-fold cross validation using k = 3
    - Predict
    - Calculate accuracy for test data
